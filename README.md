# Better End Potato Edition

This is a fork of [BetterEnd Reforked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend-re-forked) bysomeoneelse, which is a fork of [BetterEndforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend-forge-port) by Beethoven92.

Clean up codes (Suggestions of IDEA) and fix a duplicate registry bug.

[There is a script](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Tankoptimization/blob/main/Tankofpascript/ChorusFruitsFromEnderman.zs) I wrote that let Endermans drop Chorus Fruit so you won't go crazy about it. Use it with CraftTweaker pls.

Another suggestion: use this mod with [this config file](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Tankoptimization/tree/main/Tankofpaconfig/betterendforge), it disables some ugly/incompatible/unreasonable settings.
